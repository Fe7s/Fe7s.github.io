## Dove’s five-year plan

Let me start with my recent feelings and thoughts. One week ago, a disciple of a my master (The one who will come to Beijing for postgraduate study next year) asked what she should pay attention to in her future career she was about to face, and today, One of the brothers asked me question related my job search. Now I am going to analyze my working experience based on my previous occupation history.
 
For the past years, I was very childish towards my work and life. Because I think that a little bit happy life is enough by earning some money to support my life. So I work hard even overtime. I think whatever platform it is， I am going to do it well without regret. The result doesn't matter. Recently when I was in contact with some excellent friends, discovering there are certain thresholds in  big companies. Namely two thresholds exist, one is education (985, 211 education or up), and the other is work experience in top corporations. So I consider the issue in this way, no matter how well you do at a small platform, those projects you did before are not worth mentioning at all therefore they are not recognized. What’s more, I am to reach the age to set up a family. But I still want to prove myself both in my work performance and reality life. Because there is the only one champion.  

So my five-year plan is actually the same as before. These recent ideas have added to my sense of urgency to achieve these goals.

The five-year plan starts from here:

	1.	Learn multiple skills as much as possible by being more than one expert who knows everything of sth and sth of everything. Thus I will ensure powerful competitiveness in the industry.
	2.	I will settle down emotionally identifying my miss right and my city in which we will buy the apartment and build our love nest.
 
In the third year:

	1.	Strive to create a good personal title and make myself well known in the circle.

4 to 5 years:

	1.	Focus on the family，my own family and the parents on both sides.
	2.	At the same time, get in touch with other industries in my career、enlarge my vision to have a open attitude to all trades .
